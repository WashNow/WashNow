# WashNow
A web-based platform for car-wash bays, designed for ease of use and for an efficient deployment, our system brings digital convenience to a traditionally offline service.


Thus, allowing drivers to easily locate available bays, reserve one or more time‑slots, unlock the jet‑wash upon arrival, run the washing program, pay automatically, and retrieve receipts, all within the comfort of our single user-friendly interface, and available for all types of car washes. 

 Car wash Operators/Owners on the other hand benefit from now having a dashboard to create and manage bays, define schedules and prices, while also monitoring water and energy consumption (available only on a more advanced part of the app development)
